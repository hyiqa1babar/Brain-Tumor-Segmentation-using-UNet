# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Segmentation using UNet (Streamlit App)

This project presents a web-based application built with Streamlit and PyTorch for the segmentation of brain tumors from MRI scans. It utilizes a UNet deep learning model to identify tumor regions and provides interactive visualizations, quantitative metrics, and AI-powered clinical interpretations using the Google Gemini API.

## âœ¨ Features

* **NIfTI File Upload**: Easily upload brain MRI scans in `.nii` or `.nii.gz` formats.
* **Interactive Slice Navigation**: Explore MRI volumes across Axial, Sagittal, and Coronal views with a dynamic slider.
* **UNet Deep Learning Model**: Automatic segmentation of tumor regions using a pre-trained UNet architecture.
* **Tumor Visualization**:
    * Original MRI slice display.
    * Tumor confidence maps to visualize prediction strength.
    * Overlay with tumor outline or custom colormaps (Hot, Viridis, Jet, Cool) for clear identification.
* **Quantitative Tumor Metrics**: Get instant statistics like tumor pixel count, percentage of slice, dimensions (width, height), approximate diameter, perimeter, and circularity.
* **AI Clinical Interpretation**: Leverage the Google Gemini API to generate concise, clinically-oriented explanations of the segmentation results, including potential diagnoses and next steps.
* **Multi-Slice Visualization**: View a series of adjacent slices to understand the 3D extent of the tumor.
* **Sample Data Option**: Test the application with synthetic brain MRI data if you don't have your own files.
* **Export Results**: Download the segmented tumor mask or the overlay image as PNG files.
* **Advanced Settings**: Adjust segmentation thresholds, image normalization methods, and apply post-processing like smoothing.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the application locally.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
    (Replace `your-username/your-repo-name` with your actual GitHub repository path.)

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can create one with the following contents based on the provided `App.py`:
    ```
    streamlit>=1.0.0
    torch
    numpy
    matplotlib
    nibabel
    Pillow
    requests
    scipy # For smoothing, if used
    scikit-image # For contour finding
    google-generativeai
    ```

4.  **Set up Google Gemini API Key:**
    The provided code uses a placeholder API key. For actual use, it's highly recommended to use Streamlit's secrets management.But first you will need an API key
    
    âœ… How to Get Your Gemini (Generative AI) API Key
Step 1: Create or Select a Project
Click the Select a project button at the top. Then:
Either create a new project or select an existing one.
Give it a name like "GeminiApp".

Step 2: Enable the Gemini API
Once you're inside the project:

Click the top-left menu (â˜°) > APIs & Services > Library.
Search for:

Gemini API or

Generative Language API (under Vertex AI API or PaLM API)
Click it, then press Enable.

Step 3: Create Credentials (API Key)
Go to the left menu again:

APIs & Services > Credentials
Click + Create Credentials > API key

Your key will be generated. Copy and save it securely.
(Optional but recommended) Restrict the key to only the Gemini API for safety.

Step 4: Use the Key in Your App
Put it into your .env file like this:

env
Copy
Edit
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-generated-api-key
Or into your secrets.toml (if using Streamlit Secrets):

toml
Copy
Edit
[general]
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-generated-api-key"

    * Create a `.streamlit` folder in your project's root directory.
    * Inside `.streamlit`, create a file named `secrets.toml`.
    * Add your Gemini API key to `secrets.toml`:
        ```toml
        GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
    * Replace API key in `App.py` with `st.secrets["GEMINI_API_KEY"]` for the `api_key` variable within `initialize_gemini_api()`.

### Running the Application

Once you have everything set up, run the Streamlit app from your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run App.py
